# FEV-Regression_Analysis

Forced Expiratory Volume (FEV) is an index of pulmonary function that measures the volume of air expelled after 1 second of constant effort.

This repo aims to predict the FEV given certain variables such as age, gender, height, weight, and makes use of several regression techniques to find the best model to predict FEV.

## Techniques
1. Exploratory Data Analytics
2. Standardization
3. Interpretation of Coefficient
4. T-test, F-test, ANOVA
5. Residual Plots
6. Interaction Terms
7. Box-Cox Transformation
8. Box-Tidwell Transformation
9. Multicollinearity (Correlation Matrix, Variance Inflation Factor, Condition Number)
